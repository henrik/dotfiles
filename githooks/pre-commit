# Git pre-commit hook that prevents accidentally committing things that shouldn't be, like:
#
#   * ":focus", used with RSpec/Guard
#   * "show_page", used to debug request specs
#   * "console.log" of "console.debug", used in JavaScript debugging
#   * "DO NOT COMMIT!" comments
#
# Modify the regexps to suit your needs. The error message shows the full regexp match, or just the first capture group, if there is one.
#
# To bypass this commit hook (and others), perhaps when defining ":focus" or "show_page" for the first time, commit with the "--no-verify" option.
